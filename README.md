# I CAN HAS BEER?
This is a simple site (I made for Mr Madsen) to check if today is a beer day (trick question, every day is!)

## Some stuffs
 * Webpack 3
 * Local dev (with support for api proxy)
 * Auto reload on save and all that jazz (thanks webpack)
 * Optimized build
   * Image crunching
   * Favicon building and app icon stuffs
   * Minimized content
 * Less / SCSS with autoprefixer, font-magician etc
   * You don't have to add your own google fonts etc, it just works
 * ESNEXT / Typescript support with Babel and Typescript loaders
 * AWS S3 / Cloudfront hosting
   * Deploy with invalidation
